# Cross-Platform Web Design Project

## Overview

This project is part of the "Cross-Platform Web Design" course in the "Web Development and Internet Applications" program at Algonquin College. The project involves designing a responsive and interactive website for a fictional gym called "Muscle Forge Gym." The website provides information about the gym's services, locations, timetable, plans, and includes a gallery of images.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into various sections, including:

- **HTML Files**: The project uses multiple HTML files for different sections of the website. These files are structured to present information in a clear and organized manner.

- **CSS Stylesheets**: The project includes a CSS stylesheet named "style.css" to define the visual style and layout of the website. The stylesheet ensures that the website is visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive on different devices.

- **Images**: The "images" folder contains images used throughout the website, including the gym logo and gallery pictures.

## Features

The "Muscle Forge Gym" website offers the following features:

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work seamlessly on a variety of devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. It adapts its layout and elements to ensure a great user experience.

- **Navigation**: The website includes a navigation menu with links to different sections, allowing users to easily access the information they need.

- **Information Sections**: The website provides detailed information about the gym's services, locations, timetable, and membership plans.

- **Image Gallery**: There is a gallery section showcasing images of the gym's facilities and training areas.

- **Contact Form**: Users can get in touch with the gym by filling out the contact form, providing their name, email, and a message.

## Styling

The website's visual style is based on a dark theme with contrasting fonts. It uses Google Fonts to incorporate "Bebas Neue" and "Roboto" fonts for an attractive and modern look. The navigation menu has a black background with white text, and links change color when hovered over.

## Usage

To view the "Muscle Forge Gym" website, simply open the HTML files in a web browser. You can navigate through the various sections to explore the gym's services, locations, timetable, plans, and the image gallery.

This project demonstrates the application of cross-platform web design principles to create an attractive and functional website. The "Muscle Forge Gym" website offers information about the gym's services, locations, timetable, and membership plans, and allows users to get in touch through a contact form.
